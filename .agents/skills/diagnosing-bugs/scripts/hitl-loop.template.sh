# Human-in-the-loop reproduction loop.
# Copy this file, edit the steps below, and run it.
# Template only. Never run automatically. Adapt and run only when the current
# task and root AGENTS.md explicitly authorize this local diagnostic workflow.
#
# Usage:
#   bash hitl-loop.template.sh
#
# Two helpers:
#   step "<instruction>"          → show instruction, wait for Enter
#   capture VAR "<question>"      → show question, read response into VAR
#
# At the end, captured values are printed as KEY=VALUE for the agent to parse.
